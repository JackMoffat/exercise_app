# exercise_app

Initial testing for development of a Flutter app that allows myself and others to more easily enter customized workout information, because while working with mobile spreadsheets is *mostly* fine, there is still an attrition rate in users getting used to actually tracking what their lifts and rest are like.

I've been curious about Flutter for a while and have had some earlier initial forays, but this woudl not have been possible at this speed without chatGPT. It's like having a very knowledgeable person as a guide who has simultaneously been out of the field for a while and is quick to put forth plausable, informative, and blatantly wrong answers. So it's effectively like having a mentally ancient research supervisor.
