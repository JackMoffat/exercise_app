* notes
** on internal structure representation
- because flutter / dart code isn't capable of reflection(?), to have parameters for upcoming weeks modified by parameters from previous weeks I will need to have an accessible internal representation of the progress over time

*** flattening
an exercise, which would have its own number of sets, which is handy for displaying at the outset, on the inside can be flattened down as each set is the base unit. so that eliminates one layer of nesting:
{exercise: benc

** on workout structures
*** supersets / alt sets
supersets and alt sets would likely do best nested
*** on nonstandard values / descriptions
for instance, the prowler sprints: their description doesn't fit well within the standard sets/reps/rest thing



** further parameters to add
all of the things that I've been recording between colon pairs should be added to the exercise screen.
This definitely would flesh out the exercise screen as well
